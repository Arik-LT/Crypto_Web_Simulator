# Crypto Web Simulator

## Overview

---

This is an expansion of the project I did for my cpastone during my keepcoding bootcamp a year ago. /n
The aim is to have an interactive web site to simulate crypto currency investments pulling live data from the CoinMarket Cap API. The web site will give you an infinite amount of eruos or dollars to begin with and the user can then invest the amount and track the progress of the coins as well as the total balance and son on.

## Libraries Used

---

While my last project mainly used Flask for the back end and javascript for the front end, usign SQLite3 as the database, now I decided to use only Flask, making use of Jinja, as well as Bootrsrap for the design and SQLalchemy. /n
In this iteration I added user login and authentication as well as note taking.
